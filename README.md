<details>
<summary>⚠️ Using Plexcord violates Discord's Terms of Service</summary>

<br>

**Client modifications are against Discord's Terms of Service.**

However, Discord is generally indifferent about client modifications and there are **no known cases** of users getting banned for using client mods! You should be safe as long as you don't use plugins that implement abusive behavior. All built-in Plexcord plugins are safe to use.

**That said:**

- If your account is very important to you and getting it disabled would be catastrophic, consider the risks of using **any** client mod (not just Plexcord)
- Avoid posting screenshots showing Plexcord in servers where client mods might result in a ban
- Use common sense and don't abuse Discord's systems

**Use at your own discretion.**
